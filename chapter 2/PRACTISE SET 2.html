    <u><h1>Programming Language</h1></u>
<hr>
<u><b>Definitions</b></u>
<hr>
There are many considerations when defining what constitutes a programming language.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Computer languages vs programming languages</b></u>
<pre>
    <hr>    The term <u>computer language</u> is sometimes used interchangeably
    with programming language.[2] However, the usage of both terms
    varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One 
    usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer
    languages.[3] Similarly, languages used in computing that 
    have a different goal than expressing computer programs are
    generically designated computer languages. For instance, 
    <u><b>languages</b></u> are sometimes referred to as computer
    languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used 
    for programming.[4] One way of classifying computer 
    languages is by the computations they are capable of 
    expressing, as described by the theory of computation. The 
    majority of practical programming languages are Turing 
    complete,[5] and all Turing complete languages can 
    implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and 
    Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing 
    complete, yet are often called <u><big>programming languages</big></u>.[6][7]
    However, some authors restrict the term <u><b>"programming language"</b></u> 
    to Turing complete languages.[1][8]
